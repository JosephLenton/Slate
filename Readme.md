
Slate | a terminal for web development 
======================================

Slate is an experiment to build a modern terminal,
which runs on both desktop and tablet.
It aims to mix traditional terminal development,
with modern web tools and experience.

The system supports multiple languages (currently just CoffeeScript and JS),
by the ability of having them just compile to JS.
CoffeeScript is the default as it adds a terse REPL.

The aim is to allow users to load content, and the hack the content
as they would with text on a terminal.

Common 'nix commands are re-implemented,
in a way which works better with a web development environment.
For example being able to use grep for a file system, and the properties of an object,
or being able to cat text, and images, into the terminal.

Right now the project is still in an early alpha,
and mostly an experiment, and only officially works on Windows.
