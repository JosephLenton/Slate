Slate | a terminal for web development 
======================================

Slate is an experiment to build a desktop terminal,
which aims to mix traditional terminal development with a modern web experience.

The system uses CoffeeScript for a terse REPL,
allowing you to load web pages, debug and hack on them,
using existing terminal commands.

Common 'nix commands are re-implemented,
in a way which works better with a web development environment.
For example being able to use grep for a file system, and the properties of an object,
or being able to cat text, and images, into the terminal.

Right now the project is still in an early alpha,
and mostly an experiment, and only officially works on Windows.
