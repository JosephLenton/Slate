Slate | a terminal for web development 
======================================

Slate is an experiment to build a desktop terminal,
which aims to mix traditional terminal development with a modern web experience.

The system uses CoffeeScript for a terse REPL,
allowing you to load web pages, debug and hack on them,
using existing terminal commands.
